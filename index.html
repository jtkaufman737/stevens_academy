      <h3>From Dr. CM Stevens</h3>
      <p><i>The main goal and mission of Stevens Prep Academy is "to advocate success in all students".  We achieve this goal by various means.
        The first thing we do is to accept each student at the time they need help, instead of telling them to waste time until the next semester or quarter.
        The second thing we do is academic placement testing.  We do this to find the strengths and weaknesses of every student versus throwing into an already on-going class as most other schools do.
        The third and very important thing that we do is offer small class sizes with 1 on 1 assistance and instruction. And the fourth thing we do is weekly
        evaluation of an educational program using the NC state curriculum guidelines but, conforming those guidelines to the level and pace of the student. When
        done properly, that spells student success.</i></p>
