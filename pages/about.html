<div id="para"><hr>
  <div><br/><p>Stevens Prep Academy is responsible for impacting the lives of more than 660 at-risk
  youth enabling them to redirect their lives into a more positive and productive manner.
  We focus on helping students with ADD, ADHD, autism, Aspergers and various processing
  difficulties as well as specific learning disabilities.  Stevens Prep Academy originated
  in 1988; since then, 99% of all of the students have gone on to some form of higher
  education. Graduates of Stevens Prep Academy have furthered their education by attending
  a college, a vocational school or a technical school, or even by attending universities
  overseas, with the completion of their customized academic program.<p></div><br/>
  <div><p>Stevens Prep Academy develops program curriculums based upon the individual needs of
  the students. Core standards for the curriculum are as follows: students are required
  five (5) forty-five minute sessions for Math, English, Social Studies, Science and
  Foreign Language,  Art as an elective, Martial  Arts for discipline, and Physical
  Education.  Daily homework and study time tutorial sessions are provided after school.
  Twice a week students are taken off campus for lunch.  Weekly field trips are conducted
  to a local driving range on Wednesdays, and on Fridays earned field trips to go-carts,
  putt putt or to the local bowling alley.</p></div><br/>
  <div><p>Quarterly academic goals are established between the administrator and student. Daily
  written records of progress are discussed one on one with students, as well as sent home
  to parents on a daily basis. All students are tested weekly on all subject materials.</p></div>
