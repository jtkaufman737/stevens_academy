    <p>At Stevens Preparatory Academy, we take althetics seriously. We offer all of our students regular
      physical education courses twice weekly. We try to emulate the variety of activities that a healthy
      and active member of society would do.This means incorporating things like martial arts, organized
      team sports, rock climbing, camping and hiking, and other exercise.</p>
    <p>Stevens Prep Academy is giving student athletes the opportunity to get back into the game. We have
      revamped our sports program in 2011. We have brought in a new Director of Athletic Operations,Kyle
      Solomon</p>
    <p>Coach Solomon will oversee the success of the men's basketball program bringing in 14 years of
      experience from amateur, middle school, high school and college level athletics.</p>
    <p>The men's basketball program will cater to young men in becoming better students. Character will
      be fostered through the 3 D's to success - Discipline, Determination, and Dedication. Our student
      athletes will have the ability to set and manage the direction of their lives for
      success on the court and the game of life.</p>
