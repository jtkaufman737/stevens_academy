  <div><br/><p>Dr. Stevens runs a top notch school and gets excellent results. The teacher ratio
    is about 5:1 with great individualized attention The student has the opportunity to have a well
    rounded education with great results... My son acheived excellent results (grades) and now is
    able to continue his education at a high level.</p>
    <p>End of the year activities were reat - a camping trip for a week and a full week of field
    trips. It truly was a great way to end a school year.I highly recommend this school to anyone.
    That 5:1 ratio and individualized attention is tops. it gives you a chance to succeed in school
    and life.</p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>

  <div><p>We just wanted to let you know what a difference CM Stevens Individualized Education Center
     has made in our sons life and ours. Under teh new "Block Schedule" system implemented by Wake
     County Schools, it did not address teaching students with learning disabilities. The new system
     moved too fast for our son to learn under and he suffered and struggled, each day he got further
     and further behind. Being a learning disabled student we had to work with him after school for
     a couple of hours a day and we provided him with tutors for a total of two hours a week. </p>
     <p>Our son began to hate school and his selfesteem went down. He felt stupid and was beginning
      to give up, then we found C M Stevens.C M Stevens has made such a huge difference in all our
      lives. Our son still does not like school but he wakes up each morning and willingly goes. He
      is beginning to enjoy Math, which is a major accomplishment!!!</p>
      <p>He has stated several times how school is not so bad. He is learning Spanish, if he stayed
      in the public school system he would never had been given the opportunity. Our sons self-esteem
      is rising and we actually have a child who laughs more and is more positive. He is getting a
      better academic education at C M Stevens than he would have ever received in the public school
      system. We no longer continue teaching him once he comes home from school, he does his homework
      and studies and gets to have a teens life. We also were able to stop the tutoring lessons as
      well.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions, please contact us.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
